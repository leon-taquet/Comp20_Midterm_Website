<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p>Tufts Humane Society is a non-profit animal shelter located in Medford, Massachusetts that specializes in
the rescue and care of pets all around the Boston area. We take in pets who have
been born strays or abandoned by their owners and work to find them a loving
home where they can be happy. We were founded in 1869 by a single family who
took in a stray dog of their own and gave him a happy home. Realizing that they
wanted to give other people the same sense of joy and inclusion that they had
found in giving their dog a home, they grew the Tufts Humane Society piece by piece
until it's reached the point where it is today. </p>
<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<h2>To provide a safe and loving home for all animals of all kinds.</h2>
<p> The Tufts Humane Society has dedicated itself to the rescue and adoption of all kinds of pets
    into new families who have sworn to love and care for them. Although our
    base and primary location is in the Medford-Somerville region, we support rescue efforts and
    other allied animal shelters across several states. We stay in contact and
    cooperate with animal control efforts to tell us when there are new stray
    animals or ones in need of rescue. Our short term goal is to rescue and
    safely adopt out as many abandoned and unwanted pets as possible, and to
    ensure that they receive the loving homes they deserve. Our long term goal
    is to support local legislation and rescue efforts that would increase
    awareness and provide stricter laws for animal
    safety and welfare. As an all-volunteer non-profit organization, 100% of
    the money that we raise in donations goes directly to saving and
    caring for our animals.
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
    To learn more about donating to our organization, click on the "Donations"
    tab on the navigation bar. If you would like to learn more about joining
    our growing network of foster families or more about the adoption process,
    please go to the "Contact Us" page. And if you think you're ready to adopt
    a pet and would like to begin the process, please click on the "Adopt"
    link. You can also follow us on any of our available social media accounts
    if you'd like to stay updated regarding our mission, new pets up for
    adoption, or how to sign up to be a foster family. And as always, thank you
    so much for all of your time, money, and support provided by our wonderful
    volunteers, generous donors, and loving foster and adoptive families.</p>
